# Synthetic Training Data Plan for Nested If Refactoring

## Current Performance Analysis

Based on the automated refactoring report, we've identified several areas where model performance could be improved:

| Language   | Current Issues                                           | Potential Improvements                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Complexity increased slightly after refactoring (+2)      | Better pattern selection for complexity reduction      |
| Java       | No complexity improvement (remained at 65)                | More aggressive transformation patterns                |
| JavaScript | No depth reduction (remained at 6) or complexity change  | Complete restructuring needed for deep nesting         |

## Synthetic Data Generation Strategy

### 1. Pattern-Based Generation

We'll create a synthetic dataset of before/after code pairs using the following approach:

1. **Generate Complex Nested Structures**:
   - Create templates with varying nesting depths (3-8 levels)
   - Vary condition complexity (simple comparisons to complex boolean expressions)
   - Include different control flow patterns (if-else chains, if-only blocks, mixed patterns)

2. **Create Optimal Refactorings**:
   - Implement multiple refactoring patterns for each example:
     - Guard clauses
     - Early returns
     - Method extraction
     - Switch statements (where applicable)
     - Polymorphism (for object-oriented code)

3. **Annotate with Metrics**:
   - Calculate complexity before/after
   - Measure nesting depth reduction
   - Evaluate readability improvements

### 2. Real-World Code Mining

1. **Source Code Repository Analysis**:
   - Mine open-source repositories for nested if patterns
   - Identify real-world refactoring commits that address nesting
   - Extract before/after pairs from commit history

2. **Code Review Integration**:
   - Analyze code review comments related to conditional complexity
   - Capture reviewer suggestions and implemented changes

### 3. Language-Specific Enhancements

#### JavaScript-Specific Improvements

Since JavaScript showed no depth reduction, we'll focus on:

1. **Callback Pattern Transformation**:
   ```javascript
   // Before: Nested callbacks
   function processData(data) {
     if (data) {
       validateData(data, function(isValid) {
         if (isValid) {
           transformData(data, function(transformed) {
             if (transformed) {
               // More nesting...
             }
           });
         }
       });
     }
   }
   
   // After: Promise chains or async/await
   async function processData(data) {
     if (!data) return;
     
     const isValid = await validateData(data);
     if (!isValid) return;
     
     const transformed = await transformData(data);
     if (!transformed) return;
     
     // Continue with flat structure
   }
   ```

2. **Functional Approaches**:
   - Map/filter/reduce instead of nested loops with conditionals
   - Optional chaining for nested property access
   - Nullish coalescing for default values

#### Java-Specific Improvements

For Java, we'll focus on:

1. **Strategy Pattern Implementation**:
   - Replace complex conditional logic with polymorphic behavior
   - Extract condition groups into strategy classes

2. **Builder Pattern for Complex Construction**:
   - Replace nested validation conditionals with builder pattern
   - Use validation methods that return builder instances

## Training Process

### 1. Dataset Preparation

- Generate 1,000+ synthetic examples per language
- Balance different nesting patterns and depths
- Create 80/20 train/validation split

### 2. Model Fine-Tuning

- Start with existing code-focused LLM (e.g., CodeLlama, Starcoder)
- Fine-tune on synthetic dataset with before/after pairs
- Use reinforcement learning from human feedback for quality improvements

### 3. Evaluation Metrics

- **Syntactic Correctness**: % of generated refactorings that compile/parse
- **Semantic Preservation**: % of refactorings that maintain original behavior
- **Complexity Reduction**: Average cyclomatic complexity improvement
- **Depth Reduction**: Average nesting depth reduction
- **Human Preference**: Blind evaluations by experienced developers

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Synthetic data generation framework
2. **Week 3-4**: Generate initial dataset and baseline model
3. **Week 5-6**: Fine-tune model and evaluate performance
4. **Week 7-8**: Iterate on problem areas and expand dataset

## Integration with RefactAI

1. **Model Deployment**:
   - Integrate fine-tuned model as an alternative refactoring engine
   - Allow A/B testing between rule-based and ML-based approaches

2. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Capture user acceptance/rejection of suggestions
   - Use accepted refactorings to further improve the model
   - Create continuous learning pipeline

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combine rule-based transformations with ML suggestions
   - Use ML for pattern recognition and rule-based for transformation
   - Implement confidence scoring to select best approach

## Expected Improvements

| Language   | Current Performance                | Target After Training                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python     | 57% reduction in nested blocks    | 75% reduction, -5 complexity score     |
| Java       | 64% reduction, no complexity Î”    | 80% reduction, -10 complexity score    |
| JavaScript | 60% reduction, no depth reduction | 75% reduction, -2 max depth levels     |

## Conclusion

By implementing this synthetic training data approach, we can significantly improve the RefactAI system's ability to refactor nested conditional structures. The combination of pattern-based generation, real-world code mining, and language-specific optimizations will create a comprehensive dataset that addresses the current limitations in our refactoring engine.

This approach will not only improve the specific metrics for nested if refactoring but will also establish a framework for training models on other refactoring patterns in the future.
