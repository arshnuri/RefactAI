# Troubleshooting Common CLI Issues

## AST Validation Error
If you encounter the following error when refactoring files:
```
‚ùå Error refactoring <file_path>: 'InteractiveRefactorCLI' object has no attribute 'validate_refactored_code_with_ast'
```

This issue has been fixed in the latest version. Run the following fix script:
```bash
python D:\RefactAI\fix_cli_validation.py
```

This script updates the CLI code to use the correct validation method name.

## AST Validator Syntax Error
If you encounter a warning about AST validation:
```
Validation error: 'ASTValidator' object has no attribute 'validate_syntax'
```

Run the following fix script:
```bash
python D:\RefactAI\fix_ast_validator.py
```

This script adds the missing `validate_syntax` method to the `ASTValidator` class.
